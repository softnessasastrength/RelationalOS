## Emotional Security Statement

RelationalOS protects emotional vulnerability like others protect passwords.  
Your story is sacred. Your pain is not for profit. Your trust is never assumed.

## 🔐 What We Protect

- Survivorship data (field journals, suicide notes, trauma confessions)
- Emotional blueprints (rituals, how-tos, internal states)
- Queer, neurodivergent, and sexually open identities
- Anything shared in rawness, grief, or truth

---

## 🧠 Threat Model

We don’t worry about malware.  
We worry about invalidation.  
We don’t fear breaches of code.  
We fear breaches of trust.
