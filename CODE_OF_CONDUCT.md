# 💬 Code of Conduct for RelationalOS

This isn’t just a repo.  
It’s a graveyard, a resurrection site, and a living room for the emotionally raw.  
So here’s how we keep it safe and sacred.

---

## 🖤 1. No Judgment. Ever.

This space holds suicidal thoughts, broken relationships, rage, kink, grief, lies, numbness, and resurrection.  
We do **not** judge survival strategies.  
We honor the mess.

---

## 🧠 2. Assume Everyone’s Been Through Some Shit

If someone shares a dark truth, hold it. Don’t fix it.  
If you can’t hold it, step back.  
Silence is better than shame.

---

## 🧃 3. Nourish, Don’t Drain

Bring presence. Bring patience. Bring realness.  
This isn’t a space to trauma-dump without consent.  
We’re here to **co-hold**, not collapse into each other.

---

## 🧵 4. Identity Is Fluid, Not Up for Debate

We welcome all identities—gender, sexuality, neurotype, kink, emotion-style, aesthetic.  
No debating human dignity.  
Ever.

---

## 🛠️ 5. Feedback Is a Gift, Not a Weapon

Offer edits with love.  
Say:  
> “This hit me deep, what if we tried…”  
Not:  
> “This is wrong.”

We build by amplifying, not by undermining.

---

## 🚫 6. Zero Tolerance for Cruelty

No racism.  
No misogyny.  
No queerphobia.  
No ableism.  
No emotional invalidation.

You will be removed without apology. We do not negotiate with abusers.

---

## 🤝 7. Protect the Sacred

This space is holy because it’s honest.  
Treat it like you would a friend’s last voicemail.  
Don’t screenshot it for clout. Don’t monetize someone’s truth.  
Hold it. Or walk away.

---

## 📮 If You Need to Report Something

Contact the repo owner directly through GitHub issues or private channels.  
We take harm seriously. Silence is not neutrality—it’s complicity.

---

This isn’t a sanitized space.  
It’s a sanctuary for what’s **unsanitized.**

Come as you are.  
But come with care.
