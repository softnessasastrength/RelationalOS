# RelationalOS

RelationalOS is an emotional operating system.

A living movement.
A counterculture of care.
A new blueprint for how we witness, hold, and heal each other.

Built from the ashes of silence and the wreckage of survival, this system isn't just codeâ€”it's **presence**.
No judgment. No diagnosis. Just truth, connection, and radical human witness.

### Domains:

- **Education:** talks for youth, peer healing tools, truth-based curriculum
- **Mental Health:** tools for therapists and the untherapied, reflection-based models
- **Tech:** ethical emotional AI, presence-aware models, healing conversations
- **Art:** zines, spoken word, digital and analog confessions
- **Activism:** emotional literacy, softness as protest, presence as revolution

This is your invitation to build with us.
